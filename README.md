##Overview
This is a Hangman game with difficulties and sounds. The user is able to chose the level difficulty to play. 
The sounds will be played for correct guesses, wrong guesses, winning, and losing.

##Screenshot
(insert a screenshot here. You may opt to get rid of the title for it. You need at least one screenshot. Make it actually appear here, don't just add a link.)

Here's a demonstration of how to display an image that's uploaded to this repo:

##Concepts Demonstrated
Identify the OPL concepts demonstrated in your project. Be brief. A simple list and example is sufficient. 
* **Data abstraction** is used to provide access to the elements of the RSS feed.
* The objects in the OpenGL world are represented with **recursive data structures.**
* **Symbolic language processing techniques** are used in the parser.

##External Technology and Libraries

For the GUI code was used bitmap% object which is generated by a string corresponding to the contents of a url struct and is generating the deck for the hangman.
This is provided by the library provided by net/url https://docs.racket-lang.org/net/url.html?q=net%2Furl . Another library used for GUI is the lang/plt-pretty-big-text module which is similar to the HtDP. https://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp/index.html?q=lang%2Fplt-pretty-big-text#%28mod-path._lang%2Fplt-pretty-big-text%29 
Also for the canvas and the text-field box, which exist in the racket/gui/base https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/index.html?q=racket%2Fgui%2Fbase
The sounds played using rsound audio streams https://docs.racket-lang.org/rsound/index.html?q=rsound .

```scheme
(map (lambda (x) (foldr compose functions)) data)
```
####Laura 
This expression is loading the deck image into a 'canvas' by using the bitmap% object generating the contents of a url struct.

```scheme
; Make a frame by instantiating the frame% class 
(define f (new frame% [label "Hang me, with sounds!"] [width 600] [height 600]))
(define bm (make-object bitmap% (get-pure-port (string->url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oplS16projects/Laura-Willis/master/Deck.png"))))

(define pos -30)
;; Derive a new canvas (a drawing window) class
(define mycanvas%
  (class canvas%
  ;; Call the superclass init, passing on all init args
    (super-new)
    (inherit get-dc)
	;; Define overriding method to handle image repainted in the canvas 
         (define/override (on-paint)
            (let ([my-dc (get-dc)])
              (send my-dc draw-bitmap bm pos pos)))))

```
